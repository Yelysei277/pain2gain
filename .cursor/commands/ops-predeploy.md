# 🚀 /ops-predeploy — Pre-Deploy Validation

## 🧠 Purpose
Run a comprehensive pre-deploy validation to ensure the project is fully ready for production deployment.

## 🧩 Instructions
- Check that the project **builds successfully** without warnings or errors.  
- Validate **dependency integrity** and ensure no broken or outdated packages.  
- Verify all required **environment variables** and configuration paths are properly set.  
- Run all essential **build or start commands** to confirm they execute cleanly.  
- Clean up **temporary files**, build artifacts, and unused logs.  

## ✅ Output
A clean, validated, and deployment-ready project state.  
Output should confirm successful checks or include brief summaries of any detected issues.

## 💡 Notes
Focus on ensuring production stability — no experimental code, no placeholder configs, and no missing dependencies.
