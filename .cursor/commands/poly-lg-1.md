# 🧩 /poly-lg-1 — Implementation Compliance

## 🧠 Purpose
Verify and complete the implementation to ensure it fully matches the technical specification.

## 🧩 Instructions
- Review all generated files for alignment with the technical requirements.  
- Identify any missing logic, functions, or integration steps.  
- Add or adjust code where necessary to achieve full compliance with the spec.  
- Apply small structural fixes if something is misplaced or inconsistent.  
- Ensure architecture, naming, and data flow match the defined plan.  

## ✅ Output
All necessary files updated and corrected for full implementation compliance.  
No commentary — only clean, fixed code.

## 💡 Notes
Prioritize completeness and correctness over optimization at this stage.
