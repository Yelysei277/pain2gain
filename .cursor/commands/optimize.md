# ⚡ /optimize — Improve Performance and Efficiency

## 🧠 Purpose
Enhance code performance and resource efficiency without altering functionality.

## 🧩 Instructions
- Optimize **async chains**, loops, and database or API queries.  
- Reduce **redundant operations** and unnecessary data fetching.  
- Introduce **caching** or memoization where beneficial.  
- Eliminate heavy computations or synchronous bottlenecks.  
- Validate measurable performance improvements through simplified logic or reduced calls.  

## ✅ Output
Optimized, functionally equivalent code with improved performance.  
No explanations — only updated source files.

## 💡 Notes
Focus on practical, impactful optimizations.  
Avoid micro-optimizations that reduce readability or maintainability.
