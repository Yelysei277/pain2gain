# 🧹 /poly-md-3 — Final Review & Standardization

## 🧠 Purpose
Conduct a complete final review of the codebase to ensure production readiness and consistent standards across all modules.

## 🧩 Instructions
- Confirm that everything runs correctly end-to-end.  
- Remove any remaining logs, placeholders, or debug helpers.  
- Enforce consistent types, interfaces, and project structure.  
- Simplify or refactor minor areas where possible **without changing functionality**.  
- Ensure the project meets production quality and readability standards.  

## ✅ Output
A finalized, production-ready codebase — clean, consistent, and maintainable.

## 💡 Notes
Treat this as the final verification stage before release or QA testing.
