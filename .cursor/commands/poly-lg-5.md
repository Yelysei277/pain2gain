# 🧭 /poly-lg-5 — Final Project Validation

## 🧠 Purpose
Perform a complete final review and fix pass to prepare the project for release.

## 🧩 Instructions
- Confirm all **imports, exports, and paths** are valid and consistent.  
- Verify that the project or CLI **runs successfully end-to-end**.  
- Remove any remaining **console logs**, debug helpers, and temporary comments.  
- Ensure the **folder structure is clean and minimal**, containing only required files.  
- Apply any last small fixes or structural corrections before deployment.  

## ✅ Output
A fully validated, production-ready codebase — clean, minimal, and stable.

## 💡 Notes
Treat this as the “release candidate” review.  
No experimental or incomplete features should remain at this point.
