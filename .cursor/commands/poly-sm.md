# ⚙️ /poly-quick — Complete Self-Contained Polish Pass

## 🧠 Purpose
Perform a full, self-contained polish pass on all generated code to ensure it is fully correct, consistent, and production-ready.

## 🧩 Instructions
- Verify and complete all required logic, handlers, and integrations based on the task and context.  
- Fix syntax, imports, typing, and async logic issues.  
- Remove unused or temporary code, logs, and placeholders.  
- Ensure consistent structure, naming, formatting, and error handling.  
- Validate architecture alignment and adjust file/function placement if necessary.  
- Refactor or simplify where appropriate, **without changing functionality**.  

## ✅ Output
Finalized, production-ready code only — no commentary or explanations.

## 💡 Notes
Ideal for compact tasks or single-feature updates where a single polishing pass is sufficient.
