Perform a complete, self-contained polish pass on all generated code to ensure it is **fully correct, consistent, and production-ready**.

### Objectives:

- Verify and complete all required logic, handlers, and integrations based on the task and context.
- Fix syntax, imports, typing, and async logic issues.
- Remove unused or temporary code, logs, and placeholders.
- Ensure consistent structure, naming, formatting, and error handling.
- Validate architecture alignment and adjust file/function placement if necessary.
- Refactor or simplify where appropriate **without changing functionality**.

Apply all corrections and improvements directly — output **only the finalized, clean code**.
