### **Fix & Polish**

Perform a full project-level correction pass:

- Resolve syntax, import, and TypeScript issues.
- Remove unused variables, imports, and temporary code.
- Ensure consistent naming, formatting, and error handling.
- Verify that all async logic, API calls, and paths are valid.

Apply all fixes directly — no explanations, only corrected code.
