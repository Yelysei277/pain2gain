# 🧩 /dev-plan — Implementation Planning

## 🧠 Purpose
Build a clear implementation plan before writing any code.

## 🧩 Instructions
- Read the specification from the provided file or content below.  
- Summarize the main objectives and expected deliverables in a few bullet points.  
- List required files, modules, functions, and key dependencies to be created or updated.  
- Describe the data flow between backend, frontend, and storage (and external services, if any).  
- Present a clear, step-by-step implementation plan that can be directly followed by `/dev-impl`.  

## ✅ Output
A concise Markdown plan that includes:
- Goals & deliverables  
- A list of files/modules to touch  
- Data flow overview  
- Step-by-step implementation checklist  

## 💡 Notes
Focus on clarity and sequence — the plan should be easy to follow without further clarification.  
Avoid generating any code at this stage.
