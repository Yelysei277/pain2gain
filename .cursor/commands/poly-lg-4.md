# ✂️ /poly-lg-4 — File Refactor & Modularization

## 🧠 Purpose
Split large or overloaded files into smaller, focused modules to improve maintainability and scalability.

## 🧩 Instructions
- Identify large files or files combining multiple logical concerns.  
- Split them into smaller **modules, helpers, or subcomponents**.  
- Group new files logically within the existing folder structure.  
- Update **imports and exports** across the project accordingly.  
- Ensure the main entry point (CLI, API, or UI) still functions end-to-end after refactoring.  

## ✅ Output
Refactored and modularized codebase with smaller, well-structured files.  
All imports and dependencies correctly updated.

## 💡 Notes
Maintain existing behavior — no functional changes allowed.  
Focus solely on structure and maintainability improvements.
