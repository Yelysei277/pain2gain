# 🧹 /poly-lg-3 — Codebase Cleanup & Standardization

## 🧠 Purpose
Clean and standardize the entire codebase for clarity, maintainability, and consistency.

## 🧩 Instructions
- Ensure each file has a **single clear responsibility**.  
- Keep naming conventions **consistent** across all files and functions.  
- Enforce **explicit and accurate TypeScript types** throughout the codebase.  
- Remove **redundant comments**, temporary notes, or placeholder text.  
- Simplify logic where possible without changing functionality.  
- Unify code formatting, indentation, and file-level structure.  

## ✅ Output
Updated, standardized code files — cleaner, more readable, and production-ready.

## 💡 Notes
Focus on consistency and readability.  
Do not change existing functionality or introduce new logic during cleanup.
