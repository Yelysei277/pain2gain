### **Codebase Cleanup & Standardization**

Clean and Standardize the Codebase

Refactor and polish the code for readability and consistency:

- Make sure each file has a single clear responsibility.
- Keep naming consistent across all files and functions.
- Enforce explicit and correct TypeScript types.
- Remove redundant comments or placeholder text.
- Simplify code where possible without changing functionality.
    
Update all files directly with cleaner, standardized code.
