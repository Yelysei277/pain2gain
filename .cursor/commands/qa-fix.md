# 🧪 /qa-fix — Fix Failing or Outdated Tests

## 🧠 Purpose
Repair failing, broken, or outdated tests and ensure that the entire suite runs successfully.

## 🧩 Instructions
- Identify all **failing or outdated test cases**.  
- Update test logic, mocks, imports, and expectations as needed.  
- Ensure tests align with current function signatures and data flow.  
- Verify that all tests **pass successfully** after fixes.  

## ✅ Output
All test files corrected and passing cleanly, with updated and synchronized logic.

## 💡 Notes
Avoid rewriting tests unnecessarily — update only what’s required to restore reliability.  
Focus on stability and correctness across the entire test suite.
