## 🧠 Purpose
Review all generated code to ensure it fully matches the task requirements, specification, and intended architecture.

## 🧩 Instructions
- Add or fix any missing logic, handlers, or integrations.  
- Ensure the implementation matches the described **architecture and data flow**.  
- Adjust file or function structure if something is misplaced or incomplete.  
- Check that all modules interact correctly and follow project conventions.  
- Bring the codebase to a state that fully satisfies the initial specification.  

## ✅ Output
Updated code that is fully aligned with the functional and architectural requirements.  
All changes applied directly — no additional explanations.

## 💡 Notes
