# 🧪 /qa-cover — Test Coverage & Generation

## 🧠 Purpose
Check the current test coverage and automatically generate or update unit tests as needed.

## 🧩 Instructions
- Analyze the provided context (file, folder, or module).  
- If **tests are missing** — generate appropriate **unit tests** with realistic cases and assertions.  
- If **tests already exist** — review them for correctness and update outdated parts.  
- Ensure tests cover key logic paths, edge cases, and error scenarios.  
- Maintain consistent naming and structure in the `/tests` directory.  

## ✅ Output
Updated or newly generated test files with meaningful coverage improvements.

## 💡 Notes
Focus on correctness and clarity in tests, not just coverage percentage.  
Prefer readable, minimal test code that demonstrates intended behavior.
