# 🌱 Product Vision — Two Levels of Analysis

Pain2Gain is not just a generator of startup ideas — it's a system for **continuous discovery**:  
understanding where new ideas emerge (**Breadth**) and how viable they really are (**Depth**).

## 🌍 Breadth Analysis — Exploring the Landscape

**Goal:**  
Capture the big picture: detect which topics, problems, and niches are gaining traction.

**Core ideas:**

- Categorize ideas by themes and subreddits.
- Measure engagement (upvotes, comments, frequency).
- Identify clusters of recurring pain points.
- Track trends like “AI tools for creators”, “health productivity”, etc.

**Potential metrics:**

- Growth rate of discussions by topic.
- Average engagement per idea cluster.
- Trend evolution over time.

**Example use:**

> “Show which areas gained the most attention over the past two weeks.”

## 🔍 Depth Analysis — Validating and Expanding Ideas

**Goal:**  
Dive deep into top-performing ideas to evaluate their real-world potential.

**Core ideas:**

- Select top-scoring ideas and perform competitor scans (Google, ProductHunt, GitHub).
- Identify market gaps and differentiation points.
- Assess feasibility and monetization potential.
- Auto-generate one-pager idea summaries with insights.

**Possible outputs:**

- Validation score (`unique`, `crowded`, `promising niche`)
- Competitive overview
- LLM-based short pitch generation

**Example use:**

> “Evaluate the idea ‘AI note-taker for students’ — show competitors and potential gaps.”

Together, **Breadth** and **Depth** turn Pain2Gain into a **founder’s decision engine** —  
not just generating ideas, but helping understand _what to build and why it matters_.
