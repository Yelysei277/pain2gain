# T11 — Feed “New” Badge

**Goal:**
Highlight recently generated ideas with a “New” badge that aligns with the marketing requirements of the landing/feed experience.

---

## 🍀 Deliverables

- Updated `ProductIdea` typing (or companion metadata) that includes a created timestamp or freshness flag.
- Feed logic to determine whether an idea is “new”.
- UI badge component or inline styles rendered on each qualifying card.
- Tests or manual QA notes verifying the badge rule.

---

## 🛠 Steps

1. **Define freshness source:**
   - Prefer `created_at` from Supabase when available.
   - For JSON fallback, store a generated timestamp alongside each idea.
2. **Extend data types:**
   - Update `ProductIdea` (and related DB mapping) to include `createdAt: string` or `isNew: boolean`.
   - Ensure API responses pass the new field through to the client.
3. **Implement freshness rule:**
   - Recommended default: mark ideas created within the last 24 hours as “New”.
   - Provide a fallback (e.g., mark the newest N ideas) if timestamps are missing.
4. **Render the badge:**
   - Add a styled badge to `idea-card.tsx` that matches spec (e.g., uppercase label, accent color).
   - Ensure badge coexists cleanly with existing topic/score chips.
5. **QA:**
   - Verify badge visibility for fresh ideas and absence on older entries.
   - Confirm responsive layout still renders correctly.

## 💡 Notes

- When storing timestamps locally, use ISO strings to keep parsing predictable.
- Consider centralizing freshness logic in a helper to allow reuse in emails or other surfaces.
- Keep styling consistent with current inline-CSS approach to minimize scope creep.
