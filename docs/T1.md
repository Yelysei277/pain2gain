# T1 — Mock Reddit Data + Types

**Goal:**  
Load realistic Reddit mock data and serve it as typed objects.

---

## 🍀 Deliverables
- `data/reddit-mock.json` (~100 posts)  
- Type definitions  
- Data loading functions  

---

## 🛠 Steps
1. Create JSON mock file:  
   ```json
   {
     "id": "abc",
     "subreddit": "r/startups",
     "title": "Can't find a good feedback tool",
     "body": "We tried Notion but it doesn't fit our workflow.",
     "upvotes": 120,
     "num_comments": 30,
     "created_utc": 1730512345
   }
   ```
2. Define types in `src/types/reddit.ts`:  
   ```ts
   export interface RedditPost {
     id: string;
     subreddit: string;
     title: string;
     body: string;
     upvotes: number;
     num_comments: number;
     created_utc: number;
   }
   ```
3. Implement `src/lib/reddit-source.ts`:  
   - `loadRedditPosts(): Promise<RedditPost[]>`  
   - `pickRandomPosts(posts, count: number)`  
4. (Optional) add small tests for data validity.
